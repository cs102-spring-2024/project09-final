# CS 102 Final Project

For this project, I am requiring a "Diary"; see the project for more details. I've included one example entry.

# Diary Entries

## April 23

Prof. Helmuth setup the repository:
- I created a .gitignore file, to make git not track unneeded files.
- I copied Prof. Strash's CMakeLists.txt file from last semester. You'll learn how to use this in lab this week.
- I made this readme!

## April 26

Your first entry should go here (or earlier if you start earlier).
